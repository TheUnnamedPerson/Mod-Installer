# Mod-Installer
 Use This To Install Mods Easilly.
## How to Use
 First Make Sure that they install forge / fabric / quilt (Whatever modloader is being used).
 Then Put the Desired Mods into the mods folder in contents.
 Lastly, Run the .bat file included.

 Be warned this will delete everything in the mods folder.
 Did that so if you wanted to update the mods being used, you dont gotta tell your less technologically literate friends to add / remove specific mods.

## Other Directories

 If they didn't install minecraft to the default location on the C Drive, go into the .bat file and replace %appdata% with the path to the .minecraft.
 If you don't know what that means then MC was probably installed to the default location which means this will work fine.

 This can also work for other games like Lethal Company.
 Just replace the inside of the contents folder with whatever you want installed (ie replace mods with Bepin EX for lethal company) and then go into the bat and change the location.

 This is an incredibly basic project purely meant for people who want to easilly help their friends instll stuff without teching them what a %appdata% is.
